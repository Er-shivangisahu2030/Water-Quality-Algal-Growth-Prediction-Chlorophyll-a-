# Automated Dataset Creation and Growth Prediction of Surface Algae in Hirakud Reservoir

This project focuses on analysing the growth of algae and surface vegetation in the Hirakud Dam reservoir using a sequence of raw satellite images captured over different time periods. The primary objective is to convert these unprocessed images into a structured, labelled dataset that quantifies the spatial extent of algae across the water surface for each timestamp. Image processing techniques are applied to isolate algal regions, compute their coverage, and generate time-series measurements.

Using this curated dataset, the project further develops a predictive model to estimate how algae concentration will evolve over time under sustained water-holding conditions. The model helps identify the duration after which algae growth becomes significant and may affect water quality or reservoir management.

Overall, the work provides a systematic framework for dataset creation, temporal analysis, and growth prediction of algae in large water bodies, demonstrated specifically on the Hirakud Dam using satellite imagery.
